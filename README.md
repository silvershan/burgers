# Eat-Da-Burger!

This app allows you to add a burger to a list.  The burger can then be devoured and, once devoured, can be deleted.  The list is updated on the MySQL database and allows the user to interact directly with the app.  This app utilizes both front-end and back-end, making it a full stack web application.
